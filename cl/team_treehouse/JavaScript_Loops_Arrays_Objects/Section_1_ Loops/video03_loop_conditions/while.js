// 1) Generate a random number from 1 to 10000. This is the number the computer needs to guess
// 2)Enter a while loop - inside this loop the computer will "guess" a random number. If the number the computer guesses mathces the number generated at the begining of the program, the loop ends, if not, the loop continues until the correct number is guessed.
// 3) Exit the loop and print the random number and the number of times it took the computer to guess it.
